Version 0.2
-----------
* See syco-private step 1-6
* Change version in app.py, set tag for version 0.2

Version 0.25
------------
# Upgrade scripts to centos 6
# Setup bond and bridge installation in kvm host
# Move all host dependent functions from app.py to it's own host/device class.
  That will be instansiated from config.py.
  config.getHost("fo-tp-install").get_mac()
  config.getHost("fo-tp-install").get_ip()
# Replace all host_name with hostname.
# Set the linux root email address. The one that are emailed when for example sudo is executed without permission.
# Upgrade scripts to centos 6
# Removed fareoffice relations in the public scripts and documentation.
# Setup ip in kickstart, front and back.
# Test installGuestWithDVD.
# Test installation of install server
# Make it possible to install from the admin-net. gateways and such.
# Test install fo-tc-ldap with cobbler.
# Added popen that can replace shell_exec when events is not needed.
* Do the sync on install server again.

* Install all guests on fo-tc-vh01

* Is a gatway configured on the kvm host after the installation.
  /etc/sysconfig/network

* Is all drivers paravirtualized on host/guest
  http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/Virtualization/#id3302819

* Is the ram option in install.cfg working? Code looks ok, verify after
  all guests are installed.

Version 0.3
-----------
* installBind
  Remove fareoffice relation.
  /Users/dali/mount/fo-tp-dalitst/syco/var/dns/fareonline.net:
* Test bind installation with https://www.ultratools.com

Version 0.4
-----------
* installNagios

Version 3.9 (iptables)
----------------------
# Refactor iptable.py, add a rule chain that can be controlled from other scripts?
# Iptable rules on fo-tp-install should be synced in iptables-setup.
# Are all iptables rules tested and moved to iptables-setup.
# http://security.blogoverflow.com/2011/08/base-rulesets-in-iptables/
* Separate rules for eth0 and eth1, br0 and br1?
* Create the allowed_tcp/udp directly under INPUT to first filter on tcp or udp.
  This will optimize all rules by "50%".
* Don't try to delete chains, when they don't exist. To remove the error message from iptables.
* Iptables are blocking on ip numbers. If a domain name is used, it will cache
  the ip-number. We need to do something about this.
* iptables-setup
  http://lonesysadmin.net/2007/10/29/how-to-install-a-tftp-server-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux/
  # /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config
  # Add IPTABLES_MODULES="ip_conntrack_tftp"
* Add recent http://www.snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/
  http://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/scripts/recent-match.txt
* SSH to the server should only be allowed from certain ips.
* Write fireall/router iptables forwarding script.

Version 4
---------
* Move all companies repos to git or create install-svn.
* Add right licence to all files. Add licence file to root folder.
* remote-install-ssh-keys (on all syco-servers)

Monitor
-------
* Check this http://snorby.org/
* Check cpu sensors (temp), IPMI??
* Build report tool to check swap memory.
  A webserver should never ever have to swap, as swapping increases the latency
  of each request beyond a point that users consider "fast enough".
* Monitor cpu temp
* Check that no swap exists on the kvm hosts.

Hardening
---------
* Read doc for centos 6
  http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/
* installClam
* Read http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/index.html
* Harden kickstart files according to
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/kickstart.template
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/post/
* Harden according to, or later version.
  http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf
* http://www.sans.org/score/checklists/linuxchecklist.pdf
* http://serverfault.com/questions/89923/what-tool-or-scripts-do-you-use-to-audit-a-linux-box
* Harden, remove/disable these services
  hplip,isdn,kudzu,xfs,nfs,xinetd,rhnsd,kdump,readahead_later,messagebus,haldaemon,apm
* Add user used by syco, so it don't need to use root. Then prevent root ssh login.
  user --name=syco --uid=500 --groups=wheel,root --password=nothingspecial
* Immunize all config files with "chattr +i xx", files that shouldn't be modified by anyone.
* semanage on all files we are using chcon on.
* Mask password that are written to the stdout.
* Add epel repo to fo-tp-install
  repo --name=lepel       --baseurl=http://10.0.0.1:81/yum-repos/epel/i386
  rpm -Uhv http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

Remote-install
--------------
* install-guests "virsh list" just print a .
* remote-install should log all output to file, one for each server/thread.
  http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logging-to-multiple-destinations
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/616645/how-do-i-duplicate-sys-stdout-to-a-log-file-in-python
* Looks like remote-install are doing multiple installations to the same server
  at the same time. Maybe starting multiple threads for each server.
* syco remote-install, should loop and wait for all clients to become alive.
  Then run all commands on them.
* The guests should use the repos from the cobbler server.
* The guest should be locally "firewalled" to not be able to reach out to
  anything more then they need.
* Run "remote-install-deamon" on cobbler server.
* The remote-install deamon should check for changes in install.cfg.
* Add all output from syco to a log file.
* Add "syco remote-install" in kickstart for fo-tp-install

Refactoring / Stability
-----------------------
* Refactoring of password and passwordStore
* Use properties instead of getters in config
* install-mysql-replication should wait until users are installed on primary database.
* restorecon -R -v /home/$ACCOUNT/.ssh
* cobbler reposync has problems when selinux is enabled.
  See tmp/test-cobbler-sync.sh

KVM
---
* Add --cpuset=auto thingy to cobbler installed guests, to get the right NUMA.
* Setup console

* installOpenvpn, harden openvpn, jailroot, ta.key, Unprivileged mode
  http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security
* See all todos in installMysql
* User can use syco with a console/shell behaviour. Much like mysql, virsh,
  asadmin console. The user can login to a remote host and run local commands.
  http://docs.python.org/library/cmd.html
  http://jessenoller.com/2009/02/05/ssh-programming-with-paramiko-completely-different/
