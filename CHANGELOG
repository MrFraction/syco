* Rename to syco/syscon.

* installHudson
* instalSonar

* Configure openvpn for ubuntu https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/openvpn.html

* Uninstall programs, modify version.cfg

* Install clam

* Iptable rules on fo-tp-install should be synced in iptables-setup

* Build report tool to check swap memory.
  A webserver should never ever have to swap, as swapping increases the latency
  of each request beyond a point that users consider "fast enough".
* Immunize all config files with "chattr +i xx", files that shouldn't be modified by anyone.
* semanage on all files we are using chcon on.
* Mask password that are written to the stdout.
* -f (force), will ignore the version.check_executed()
* Is the ram option in install.cfg working? gf computer hasn't enough memory.
* Set the linux root email address. The one that are emailed when for example sudo is executed without permission.
* Add right licence to all files. Add licence file to root folder.
* installOpenvpn, has the client openvpn certs a unique common name?
* installOpenvpn, harden openvpn, jailroot, ta.key, Unprivileged mode
  http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security
* Write installLDAP.py script.
* Add epel repo to fo-tp-install
  repo --name=lepel       --baseurl=http://10.0.0.1:81/yum-repos/epel/i386

* Harden kickstart files according to
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/kickstart.template
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/post/
* Harden according to, or later version.
  http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf
* Harden, remove/disable these services
  hplip,isdn,kudzu,xfs,nfs,xinetd,rhnsd,kdump,readahead_later,messagebus,haldaemon,apm
* Add user used by fosh, so it don't need to use root. Then prevent root ssh login.
  user --name=fosh --uid=500 --groups=wheel,root --password=nothingspecial
* Read http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/index.html

Future version
* Realtime stdout output from ssh functions.
* fosh remote-install, should loop and wait for all clients to become alive. Then run all commands on them.
* The guests should use the repos on the fo-tp-install.xï¿½
* The guest should be locally "firewalled" to not be able to reach out to anything
  more then they need. Only repo updates on fo-tp-install.
* Run "remote-install-deamon" on fo-tp-install.
* The remote-install deamon should check for changes in install.cfg.
* Add all output from fosh to a log file.
* Add "fosh remote-install" in kickstart for fo-tp-install
* Check cpu sensors (temp), IPMI??
