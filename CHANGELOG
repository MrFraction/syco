TODO
====

Version 2
---------
* Adapt installation to glassfish3
  http://glassfish.java.net/docs/3.1/installation-guide.pdf
* installLDAP.py
* installBind.py
* installHudson
* instalSonar

Version 3
---------
* Create backup for all server (fo-tp-vcs, specially)
* Set the linux root email address. The one that are emailed when for example sudo is executed without permission.

Refactor
--------
* Refactor iptable.py, add a rule chain that can be controlled from other scripts?
  Or is it good as it is, so the iptables script are not dependent on other script
* Rename installFoTpInstall and all other relations to fo-tp
* Iptable rules on fo-tp-install should be synced in iptables-setup

Version 4
---------
* Check "gerrit" code review software and implement on vcs server.
* Create install-svn
* Build report tool to check swap memory.
  A webserver should never ever have to swap, as swapping increases the latency
  of each request beyond a point that users consider "fast enough".
* Check cpu sensors (temp), IPMI??
* Is the ram option in install.cfg working? gf computer hasn't enough memory.
* Add right licence to all files. Add licence file to root folder.

Version 5
---------
* configure installCA, merge with CA stuff in installOpenVpn?
* Configure openvpn for ubuntu https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/openvpn.html
* installOpenvpn, has the client openvpn certs a unique common name?
* installOpenvpn, harden openvpn, jailroot, ta.key, Unprivileged mode
  http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security
* User can use syco with a console/shell behaviour. Much like mysql, virsh,
  asadmin console. The user can login to a remote host and run local commands.

Harden
------
* Install clam
* Read http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/index.html
* Harden kickstart files according to
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/kickstart.template
  http://kickstart-maker.googlecode.com/svn-history/r20/trunk/post/
* Harden according to, or later version.
  http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf
* Harden, remove/disable these services
  hplip,isdn,kudzu,xfs,nfs,xinetd,rhnsd,kdump,readahead_later,messagebus,haldaemon,apm
* Add user used by syco, so it don't need to use root. Then prevent root ssh login.
  user --name=syco --uid=500 --groups=wheel,root --password=nothingspecial
* Immunize all config files with "chattr +i xx", files that shouldn't be modified by anyone.
* semanage on all files we are using chcon on.
* Mask password that are written to the stdout.
* Add epel repo to fo-tp-install
  repo --name=lepel       --baseurl=http://10.0.0.1:81/yum-repos/epel/i386

Remote-install
--------------
* syco remote-install, should loop and wait for all clients to become alive.
  Then run all commands on them.
* The guests should use the repos from the cobbler server.
* The guest should be locally "firewalled" to not be able to reach out to 
  anything more then they need.
* Run "remote-install-deamon" on cobbler server.
* The remote-install deamon should check for changes in install.cfg.
* Add all output from syco to a log file.
* Add "syco remote-install" in kickstart for fo-tp-install
