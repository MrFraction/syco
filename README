DOCUMENTATION

THE FLOW OF THE "fosh remote-install"

* Download fosh from git
* On fo-tp-vh01 "fosh remote-install fo-tp-vh01"
** On fo-tp-vh01 "fosh hardening"
** On fo-tp-vh01 "fosh install-kvmhost"
** On fo-tp-vh01 "fosh install-fo-tp-install"
** On fo-tp-vh01 "fosh install-guests"
*** On fo-tp-vh01, install fp-tp-system1
*** On fo-tp-vh01, install fp-tp-gf
** On fo-tp-install "fosh git-clone"
** On fo-tp-install "fosh hardening"
** On fo-tp-install "fosh install-cobbler"
** On fo-tp-install "fosh remote-install"
*** Look for alive hosts defined in install.cfg
*** Run "fosh remote-install xx" on the host alive.
*** Continue until "remote-install" has been executed on all servers. 

TODO
---
* Install all servers with pxe.
* fosh remote-install, should loop and wait for all clients to become alive. Then run all commands on them.
* Change all ips for fo-tp-install, to 10.100.100.5
* The guests should use the repos on the fo-tp-install.
* The guest should be locally "firewalled" to not be able to reach out to anything
  more then they need. Only repo updates on fo-tp-install.
* Run "remote-install-deamon" on fo-tp-install.
* The remote-install deamon should check for changes in install.cfg.
* Add all output from fosh to a log file.
* Add "fosh remote-install" in kickstart for fo-tp-install
* Configure install.cfg to use all computers.
* Check cpu sensors (temp)
