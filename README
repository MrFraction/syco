TODO
---
* fosh remote-install, should loop and wait for all clients to become alive. Then run all commands on them.
* Run "remote-install-deamon" on fo-tp-install.
* The remote-install deamon should check for changes in install.cfg.
* Add all output from fosh to a log file.
* Add "fosh remote-install" in kickstart for fo-tp-install
